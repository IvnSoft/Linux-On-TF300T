Building the Android tools
=============================

We need to have the `mkbootimg` program so that we can prepare the final image for flashing.
Under the `android` directory of the repository, a small subset of the Android system/core
source code is present that contains the required code.

You can prepare the required tools by typing in that directory:

```
./prepare
```

Continue on with the distribution specific instructions by going to the [index page](../index.md)
