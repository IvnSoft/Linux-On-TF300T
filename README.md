Linux on TF300T
=========================

This repository consists of both a tutorial on getting Linux running
on the Transformer as well as the resources you'll need to do it.

  Apparently relative links don't work in the README on GitHub since the
  README will both be displayed at the repository root and when viewing
  the README file as "code".  Thus, this is an absolute link here.  If
  anyone knows a way to create a link to a file in the repository on GitHub
  without using an absolute link here, please let me know or submit a
  pull request.
